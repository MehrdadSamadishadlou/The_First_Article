	abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death worldwide and greatly impact quality of life and medical costs. Enormous effort has been made in research to obtain new tools for efficient and quick diagnosis and predicting the prognosis of these diseases. Discoveries of epigenetic mechanisms have related several pathologies, including cardiovascular diseases, to epigenetic dysregulation. This has implications on disease progression and is the basis for new preventive strategies. Advances in methodology and big data analysis have identified novel mechanisms and targets involved in numerous diseases, allowing more individualized epigenetic maps for personalized diagnosis and treatment. This paves the way for what is called pharmacoepigenetics, which predicts the drug response and develops a tailored therapy based on differences in the epigenetic basis of each patient. Similarly, epigenetic biomarkers have emerged as a promising instrument for the consistent diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular diseases. Their good accessibility and feasible methods of detection make them suitable for use in clinical practice. However, multicenter studies with a large sample population are required to determine with certainty which epigenetic biomarkers are reliable for clinical routine. Therefore, this review focuses on current discoveries regarding epigenetic biomarkers and its controversy aiming to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in cardiovascular patients.},

            microRNAs (miRNAs) are well-known, powerful regulators of gene expression, and their potential to serve as circulating biomarkers is widely accepted. In cardiovascular disease (CVD), numerous studies have suggested miRNAs as strong circulating biomarkers with high diagnostic as well as prognostic power. In coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure (HF), miRNAs have been suggested as reliable biomarkers matching up to established protein-based such as cardiac troponins (cT) or natriuretic peptides. Also, in other CVD entities, miRNAs were identified as surprisingly specific biomarkers – with great potential for clinical applicability, especially in those entities that lack specific protein-based biomarkers such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and acute pulmonary embolism (APE). In this regard, miRNA signatures, comprising a set of miRNAs, yield high sensitivity and specificity. Attempts to utilize miRNAs as therapeutic agents have led to promising results. In this article, we review the clinical applicability of circulating miRNAs in CVD. We are giving an overview of miRNAs as biomarkers in numerous CVD entities to depict the variety of their potential clinical deployment. We illustrate the function of miRNAs by means of single miRNA examples in CVD.},

Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is a powerful technology for biomarker discovery but requires sophisticated bioinformatics to identify robust patterns. Machine learning (ML) has become a promising tool for this purpose. However, it is sometimes applied in an opaque manner and generally requires specialized knowledge. To enable easy access to ML for biomarker discovery without any programming or bioinformatics skills, we developed “OmicLearn” (http://OmicLearn.org), an open-source browser-based ML tool using the latest advances in the Python ML ecosystem. Data matrices from omics experiments are easily uploaded to an online or a locally installed web server. OmicLearn enables rapid exploration of the suitability of various ML algorithms for the experimental data sets. It fosters open science via transparent assessment of state-of-the-art algorithms in a standardized format for proteomics and other omics sciences.},

            Prethrombotic status (PTS) in patients with stable coronary artery disease (SCAD) increases the risk of coronary thrombosis. Accumulating evidences have indicated that micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) may serve as promising biomarkers for SCAD patients with PTS. The present study aimed to identify the miRNA signature in SCAD patients with PTS and evaluated their diagnostic significance. In the screening phase, 32 differently expressed miRNAs (DEMs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were detected in 35 SCAD patients compared with 5 healthy controls by microarray. MiRNA-gene network analysis was then performed, and 4 DEMs were selected for validation with reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test in an independent cohort comprising 79 SCAD patients and 19 healthy controls. Compared with healthy controls, RT-qPCR test verified the upregulations of miR-34a-5p, miR-432–5p, and miR-370–3p detected by microarray; while the upregulation of miR-495–3p measured by RT-qPCR was not consistent with its low expression detected by microarray. Only miR-34a-5p and miR-495–3p were significantly upregulated in the PTS group compared with the non-PTS group (p {\textless} 0.01, p {\textless} 0.05). Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that PBMCs-derived miR-34a-5p and miR-495–3p may discriminate PTS with the areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.780 (confidence interval [CI]95\% = 0.673–0.866) and 0.712 (CI95\% = 0.599–0.808), respectively. The combination of miR-34a-5p and fibrinogen (FIB, a traditional biomarker for PTS) improved AUC to 0.885 (CI95\% = 0.793–0.946) and showed added predictive ability compared with FIB, with an integrated discrimination improvement of 0.201 (p {\textless} 0.01). Therefore, the combination of miR-34a-5p and FIB may serve as an efficient tool for distinguishing PTS in SCAD patients.},
