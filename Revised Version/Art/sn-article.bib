	abstract = {Gastric cancer is a disease that develops from the lining of the stomach, whereas Parkinson’s disease is a longterm degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system. Although these two diseases seem to be distinct from each other, increasing evidence suggests that they might be linked. To explore the linkage between these two diseases, differentially expressed genes between the diseased people and their normal controls were identified using the barcode algorithm. This algorithm transforms actual gene expression values into barcode values comprised of 1’s (expressed genes) and 0’s (silenced genes). Once the overlapped differentially expressed genes were identified, their biological relevance was investigated. Thus, using the gene expression profiles and bioinformatics methods, we demonstrate that Parkinson’s disease and gastric cancer are indeed linked. This research may serve as a pilot study, and it will stimulate more research to investigate the relationship between gastric cancer and Parkinson’s disease from the perspective of gene profiles and their functions.},

	abstract = {Robust multiarray analysis (RMA) is the most widely used preprocessing algorithm for Affymetrix and Nimblegen gene expression microarrays. RMA performs background correction, normalization, and summarization in a modular way. The last 2 steps require multiple arrays to be analyzed simultaneously. The ability to borrow information across samples provides RMA various advantages. For example, the summarization step fits a parametric model that accounts for probe effects, assumed to be fixed across arrays, and improves outlier detection. Residuals, obtained from the fitted model, permit the creation of useful quality metrics. However, the dependence on multiple arrays has 2 drawbacks: (1) RMA cannot be used in clinical settings where samples must be processed individually or in small batches and (2) data sets preprocessed separately are not comparable. We propose a preprocessing algorithm, frozen RMA (fRMA), which allows one to analyze microarrays individually or in small batches and then combine the data for analysis. This is accomplished by utilizing information from the large publicly available microarray databases. In particular, estimates of probe-specific effects and variances are precomputed and frozen. Then, with new data sets, these are used in concert with information from the new arrays to normalize and summarize the data. We find that fRMA is comparable to RMA when the data are analyzed as a single batch and outperforms RMA when analyzing multiple batches. The methods described here are implemented in the R package fRMA and are currently available for download from the software section of http://rafalab.jhsph.edu.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. Here, we identify biologically relevant transcripts that are significantly altered in the early phase of myocardial infarction and are associated with the development of post-myocardial infarction HF.
METHODS: We collected peripheral blood samples from patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI): n = 111 and n = 41 patients from the study and validation groups, respectively. Control groups comprised patients with a stable coronary artery disease and without a history of myocardial infarction. Based on plasma NT-proBNP level and left ventricular ejection fraction parameters the STEMI patients were divided into HF and non-HF groups. Microarrays were used to analyze mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from the study group at four time points and control group. Microarray results were validated by RT-qPCR using whole blood RNA from the validation group.
RESULTS: Samples from the first three time points (admission, discharge, and 1 month after AMI) were compared with the samples from the same patients collected 6 months after AMI (stable phase) and with the control group. The greatest differences in transcriptional profiles were observed on admission and they gradually stabilized during the follow-up. We have also identified a set of genes the expression of which on the first day of STEMI differed significantly between patients who developed HF after 6 months of observation and those who did not. RNASE1, FMN1, and JDP2 were selected for further analysis and their early up-regulation was confirmed in HF patients from both the study and validation groups. Significant correlations were found between expression levels of these biomarkers and clinical parameters. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicated a good prognostic value of the genes chosen.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates an altered gene expression profile in PBMCs during acute myocardial infarction and through the follow-up. The identified gene expression changes at the early phase of STEMI that differentiated the patients who developed HF from those who did not could serve as a convenient tool contributing to the prognosis of heart failure.},

	abstract = {Background
Despite a substantial progress in diagnosis and therapy, acute myocardial infarction (MI) is a major cause of mortality in the general population. A novel insight into the pathophysiology of myocardial infarction obtained by studying gene expression should help to discover novel biomarkers of MI and to suggest novel strategies of therapy. The aim of our study was to establish gene expression patterns in leukocytes from acute myocardial infarction patients.

Methods and Results
Twenty-eight patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were included. The blood was collected on the 1st day of myocardial infarction, after 4–6 days, and after 6 months. Control group comprised 14 patients with stable coronary artery disease, without history of myocardial infarction. Gene expression analysis was performed with Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST microarrays and GCS3000 TG system. Lists of genes showing altered expression levels (fold change {\textgreater}1.5, p{\textless}0.05) were submitted to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Gene lists from each group were examined for canonical pathways and molecular and cellular functions. Comparing acute phase of MI with the same patients after 6 months (stable phase) and with control group we found 24 genes with changed expression. In canonical analysis three pathways were highlighted: signaling of PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor), IL-10 and IL-6 (interleukin 10 and 6).

Conclusions
In the acute phase of STEMI, dozens of genes from several pathways linked with lipid/glucose metabolism, platelet function and atherosclerotic plaque stability show altered expression. Up-regulation of SOCS3 and FAM20 genes in the first days of myocardial infarction is observed in the vast majority of patients.},

	abstract = {In order to study the effects of vitamin C supplementation on gene expression and compare its action between physiological and inflammatory conditions, a pilot study was set up utilizing microarray and qPCR technologies. Five healthy volunteers were supplemented with 1 g vitamin C (Redoxon®) per day for five consecutive days. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) were isolated before and just after the last supplementation, and RNA was isolated for the Affymetrix gene 1.0 ST chip analysis. PBMNC were also, ex vivo, treated with LPS, and gene expression was quantified by means of a “Human NFkB Signaling” qPCR array. Only a very moderate effect on the baseline gene expression modulation was associated with vitamin C supplementation. However, in spite of the limited number of subjects analyzed, vitamin C supplementation resulted in a markedly different modulation of gene expression upon the inflammatory stimulus, specifically at the level of the MyD88-dependent pathway and of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 synthesis. This study suggests that vitamin C supplementation in healthy subjects, not selected according to a specific genetic profile, consuming an adequate amount of vitamin C, and having a satisfactory vitamin C plasma concentration at the baseline, does not result in a significant modification of gene expression profile. Under this satisfactory micronutrient status, supplementation of vitamin C is “buffered” within a homeostatic physiological equilibrium. Differently, following a second “hit” constituted of an inflammatory stimulus such as LPS, able to trigger a critical burst to the normal physiological state, the higher availability of ascorbic acid emerges, and results in a significant modulation of cell response.},

Enormous effort has been made in research to obtain new tools for efficient and quick diagnosis and predicting the prognosis of these diseases. Discoveries of epigenetic mechanisms have related several pathologies, including cardiovascular diseases, to epigenetic dysregulation. This has implications on disease progression and is the basis for new preventive strategies. Advances in methodology and big data analysis have identified novel mechanisms and targets involved in numerous diseases, allowing more individualized epigenetic maps for personalized diagnosis and treatment. This paves the way for what is called pharmacoepigenetics, which predicts the drug response and develops a tailored therapy based on differences in the epigenetic basis of each patient. Similarly, epigenetic biomarkers have emerged as a promising instrument for the consistent diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular diseases. Their good accessibility and feasible methods of detection make them suitable for use in clinical practice. However, multicenter studies with a large sample population are required to determine with certainty which epigenetic biomarkers are reliable for clinical routine. Therefore, this review focuses on current discoveries regarding epigenetic biomarkers and its controversy aiming to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in cardiovascular patients.},

            microRNAs (miRNAs) are well-known, powerful regulators of gene expression, and their potential to serve as circulating biomarkers is widely accepted. In cardiovascular disease (CVD), numerous studies have suggested miRNAs as strong circulating biomarkers with high diagnostic as well as prognostic power. In coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure (HF), miRNAs have been suggested as reliable biomarkers matching up to established protein-based such as cardiac troponins (cT) or natriuretic peptides. Also, in other CVD entities, miRNAs were identified as surprisingly specific biomarkers – with great potential for clinical applicability, especially in those entities that lack specific protein-based biomarkers such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and acute pulmonary embolism (APE). In this regard, miRNA signatures, comprising a set of miRNAs, yield high sensitivity and specificity. Attempts to utilize miRNAs as therapeutic agents have led to promising results. In this article, we review the clinical applicability of circulating miRNAs in CVD. We are giving an overview of miRNAs as biomarkers in numerous CVD entities to depict the variety of their potential clinical deployment. We illustrate the function of miRNAs by means of single miRNA examples in CVD.},

	abstract = {Biomarkers are of central importance for assessing the health state and to guide medical interventions and their efficacy; still, they are lacking for most diseases. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is a powerful technology for biomarker discovery but requires sophisticated bioinformatics to identify robust patterns. Machine learning (ML) has become a promising tool for this purpose. However, it is sometimes applied in an opaque manner and generally requires specialized knowledge. To enable easy access to ML for biomarker discovery without any programming or bioinformatics skills, we developed “OmicLearn” (http://OmicLearn.org), an open-source browser-based ML tool using the latest advances in the Python ML ecosystem. Data matrices from omics experiments are easily uploaded to an online or a locally installed web server. OmicLearn enables rapid exploration of the suitability of various ML algorithms for the experimental data sets. It fosters open science via transparent assessment of state-of-the-art algorithms in a standardized format for proteomics and other omics sciences.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Prethrombotic status (PTS) in patients with stable coronary artery disease (SCAD) increases the risk of coronary thrombosis. Accumulating evidences have indicated that micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) may serve as promising biomarkers for SCAD patients with PTS. The present study aimed to identify the miRNA signature in SCAD patients with PTS and evaluated their diagnostic significance. In the screening phase, 32 differently expressed miRNAs (DEMs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were detected in 35 SCAD patients compared with 5 healthy controls by microarray. MiRNA-gene network analysis was then performed, and 4 DEMs were selected for validation with reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test in an independent cohort comprising 79 SCAD patients and 19 healthy controls. Compared with healthy controls, RT-qPCR test verified the upregulations of miR-34a-5p, miR-432–5p, and miR-370–3p detected by microarray; while the upregulation of miR-495–3p measured by RT-qPCR was not consistent with its low expression detected by microarray. Only miR-34a-5p and miR-495–3p were significantly upregulated in the PTS group compared with the non-PTS group (p {\textless} 0.01, p {\textless} 0.05). Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that PBMCs-derived miR-34a-5p and miR-495–3p may discriminate PTS with the areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.780 (confidence interval [CI]95\% = 0.673–0.866) and 0.712 (CI95\% = 0.599–0.808), respectively. The combination of miR-34a-5p and fibrinogen (FIB, a traditional biomarker for PTS) improved AUC to 0.885 (CI95\% = 0.793–0.946) and showed added predictive ability compared with FIB, with an integrated discrimination improvement of 0.201 (p {\textless} 0.01). Therefore, the combination of miR-34a-5p and FIB may serve as an efficient tool for distinguishing PTS in SCAD patients.},

The Statistical Update presents the latest data on a range of major clinical heart and circulatory disease conditions (including stroke, congenital heart disease, rhythm disorders, subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, heart failure, valvular disease, venous disease, and peripheral artery disease) and the associated outcomes (including quality of care, procedures, and economic costs).
Methods: The American Heart Association, through its Statistics Committee, continuously monitors and evaluates sources of data on heart disease and stroke in the United States to provide the most current information available in the annual Statistical Update. The 2022 Statistical Update is the product of a full year’s worth of effort by dedicated volunteer clinicians and scientists, committed government professionals, and American Heart Association staff members. This year’s edition includes data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population and an enhanced focus on social determinants of health, adverse pregnancy outcomes, vascular contributions to brain health, and the global burden of cardiovascular disease and healthy life expectancy.
Results: Each of the chapters in the Statistical Update focuses on a different topic related to heart disease and stroke statistics.
Conclusions: The Statistical Update represents a critical resource for the lay public, policymakers, media professionals, clinicians, health care administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best available data on these factors and conditions.},

MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is expressed in Treg cells and is up-regulated in the context of AS and other inflammatory diseases. Aims: This study aimed to determine the role of miR21 in Treg cell regulation and gene expression during the development of AS in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Methods and Results: MiR-21 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was significantly up-regulated in patients with CHD (acute myocardial infarction (AMI) group, n=24; unstable angina (UA) group, n=21; stable angina (SA) group, n=24) compared with patients with chest pain syndrome (CPS, n=27), and miR21 expression showed an increasing trend from SA to UA to AMI patients. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis indicated that the frequencies of circulating Treg cells decreased in a manner proportionate opposite with the level of miR-21. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR) revealed a decrease in mRNA expression of forkhead box P3 (foxp3), transforming cell growth factor beta 1(TGF-$\beta1$) and smad7 (a known target gene of miR-21).ELISA analysis revealed a decrease in TGF-$\beta1$ secreted into the plasma. In addition, we transfected PBMCs with a miRNA negative control (NS-m), a miR-21 mimic (miR-21-m), a miRNA inhibitor negative control (NS-i),or a miR-21 inhibitor(miR-21-i). Up-regulation of miR-21 decreased the frequency of circulating Treg cells, decreased the expression levels of foxp3, TGF-$\beta1$ and smad7, and decreased the amount of TGF-$\beta1$ secreted into the plasma. Consistent with these observations, miR-21 down-regulation increased the frequency of circulating Treg cells, increased the expression of foxp3, TGF-$\beta1$ and smad7, and increased the amount of TGF-$\beta1$ secreted into the plasma. Conclusions: Because the smad7 expression pattern was similar to that of TGF-$\beta$, our study suggests that miR-21 can negatively regulate the frequency of circulating Treg cells through a TGF-$\beta1$/smad-independent signaling pathway in PBMCs.},

	abstract = {Background/Aims: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory condition associated with a variety of vascular diseases. Previous studies showed that both miR-29a and oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) were vital in the development of atherosclerosis. However, the relationship between miR-29a and ox-LDL remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the association of miR-29a and ox-LDL and to test whether circulating miR-29a and ox-LDL levels could predict atherosclerosis. Methods: In 170 participants, plasma levels of miR-29a were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) while plasma ox-LDL levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The relationship between miR-29a level and ox-LDL and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient and multiple liner regression. Results: Compared with the normal cIMT group, the increased cIMT group had higher levels of ox-LDL (0.47 ± 0.08 vs 0.29 ± 0.06 ng/ml, p = 0.003) and miR-29a (32.93 ± 4.26 vs 26.37 ± 1.04, p {\textless} 0.001). A positive correlation was found between ox-LDL and miR-29a (r = 0.695, p {\textless} 0.001), and both the ox-LDL (r = 0.857, p {\textless} 0.001) and the miR-29a (r = 0.753, p {\textless} 0.001) were positively related to cIMT. Furthermore, multiple liner regression indicated that a significant correlation between ox-LDL and cIMT (β = 0.768, p {\textless} 0.001), as well as between miR-29a and cIMT (β = 0.686, p {\textless}0.001). The combination of miR-29a and ox-LDL (AUC = 0.926, p {\textless} 0.001) offered a better predictive value for atherosclerosis than either miR-29a (AUC = 0.759, p {\textless} 0.001) or ox-LDL (AUC = 0.762, p {\textless} 0.001) alone. Conclusion: Increased miR-29a and ox-LDL levels were associated with an early stage of atherosclerosis, and the combination of miR-29a and ox-LDL offered better predictive values for atherosclerosis than either alone.},

	abstract = {Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a common hematopoietic malignancy with invasive activity. Drug resistance greatly contributes to the poor efficacy of chemotherapy in AML treatment. Recent research indicates that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) regulates chemotherapy resistance in malignancy.
Methods: Microarray analysis was used to screen out AML related genes, and interaction between small nucleolar RNA host gene 5(SNHG5) and miR-32, as well as that between miR-32 and DNAJB9. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and In situ hybridization(ISH) were used to determine the expression levels of SNHG5, miR-32 and DNAJB9 mRNA in AML cell lines and clinic samples. Western blot was performed to detect protein expression levels. After being treated with varying concentrations of Adriamycin(ADM), cell viability was evaluated using a cell counting kit-8(CCK8).
Results: We carried out a genome-wide LncRNA expression study and found SNHG5 aberrantly overexpressed in AML comparing to the donors. Knock-down of SNHG5 promoted sensitivity of AML cells to chemotherapy. In addition, miR-32 was identified as the downstream target of SNHG5 and miR-32 inhibitor abrogated the inhibiting effects of downregulated SNHG5 on AML cell viability. Furthermore, inhibited SNHG5 decreased DNAJB9 expression levels by sponging miR-32. The SNHG5/miR-32/DNAJB9 axis targeted autophagy to regulate chemotherapy resistance.
Conclusion: SHNG5 regulates chemotherapy resistance by targeting the miR-32/DNAJB9 axis in acute myeloid leukemia, which provided a novel potential target for AML and revealed an important mechanism of chemotherapy resistance.},

The expansion and activation of CD4+ T cells in the heart has been identified to facilitate pathological cardiac remodeling and dysfunction; however, the underlying mechanisms remained not well clarified. Herein, we found that exosomes derived from activated CD4+ T cells (CD4-activated Exos) evoked pro-fibrotic effects of cardiac fibroblasts, and their delivery into the heart aggravated cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction post-infarction. Mechanistically, miR-142-3p that was enriched in CD4-activated Exos recapitulated the pro-fibrotic effects of CD4-activated Exos in cardiac fibroblasts, and vice versa. Furthermore, miR-142-3p directly targeted and inhibited the expression of Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC), a negative WNT signaling pathway regulator, contributing to the activation of WNT signaling pathway and cardiac fibroblast activation. Thus, CD4-activated Exos promote post-ischemic cardiac fibrosis through exosomal miR-142-3p-WNT signaling cascade-mediated activation of myofibroblasts. Targeting miR-142-3p in CD4-activated Exos may hold promise for treating cardiac remodeling post-MI.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the relationship between the expression level of miR-155 and the severity of coronary lesion, and explore the action mechanism. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated form blood simple from patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), unstable angina (UAP), stable angina (SAP) and chest pain syndrome (CPS). RT-PCR was performed to analysis the expression level of miR-155 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, plasma and RAW264.7 macrophagocyte. MTT was used to analyze the cell viability of OxLDL treated RAW264.7 macrophagocyte. Results: The expression level of miR-155 in blood sample from coronary heart disease patients was much lower than in the blood sample of non-coronary heart disease (P{\textless}0.05). The level of miR-155 in PBMCs was much higher in the blood sample from CPS group than the other three group, and the level of miR-155 in plasma was higher in the CPS group than in the UAP and the AMI group, the difference was statistically significant (P{\textless}0.05). The expression level of miR-155 in PBMCs is positively associated with the level in the plasma (r=0.861, P=0.000). OxLDL can induce the expression of miR-155 in RAW264.7 macrophagocyte, decrease the cell viability of RAW264.7 macrophagocyte, and with the concentration and the treatment time of OxLDL increased, the effort become more obvious. The inhibition effort of OxLDL to RAW264.7 macrophagocyte with high miR-155 expression is much lower than the control group, and it is statistically significant after treated for 12, 24 and 48 h. Conclusions: miR-155 plays a protective role in the progression of atherosclerosis, and it may be achieved by reducing the apoptosis effort of OxLDL to RAW264.7 macrophagocyte.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Several studies suggest that cardiomyocyte-enriched miR-186 is involved in cardiac injury and myocardial infarction, and also plays an important role in atherosclerotic diseases, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Cystathionine-g-lyase (CSE) is the predominant enzyme to produce H2S in the cardiovascular system. Here, miR-186 was identiﬁed to bind to the 30UTR of CSE. In this study, we aimed at exploring whether miR-186 affects lipid accumulation and secretion of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines by targeting CSE and its underlying mechanism in human THP-1 macrophages and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (PBMDM). PBMDM just as a control group for the comparison with the THP-1 macrophages.
Methods: MiR-186 target genes, CSE 30UTR sequence and free energy were predicted and analyzed by bioinformatics analyses and dual-luciferase reporter assays. The expression of CSE mRNA and protein were measured by real-time quantitative PCR and western blot analyses. The lipid accumulation in THP-1 macrophages was detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The effects of miR-186 on secretion of IL-6, IL-1b and TNF-a were examined by ELISA. Endogenous H2S was detected by spectrophotometry. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach to decrease the expression of CSE protein and mRNA.
Results: We found that miR-186 directly inhibited CSE protein and mRNA expression through targeting CSE 30UTR by bioinformatics analyses and dual-luciferase reporter assays. HPLC assays showed that miR186 increased the lipid accumulation in human THP-1 macrophages. We also showed that miR-186 enhanced secretion of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines in human THP-1 macrophages. Using siRNA approach, we found that CSE siRNA could inhibit the miR-186 inhibitor-induced decrease in the expression of LPL protein and mRNA in human THP-1 macrophages, which was accompanied a decrease in the level of H2S.
Conclusions: MicroRNA-186 promotes macrophage lipid accumulation and pro-inﬂammatory cytokine secretion by targeting cystathionine g-lyase in THP-1 macrophages. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose  Recent emergence of miRNAs as important regulators of processes involving lesion formation and regression has highlighted miRNAs as potent therapeutic targets for the treatment of atherosclerosis. Few studies have reported the atheroprotective role of IL-35, a novel immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory cytokine; however, miRNA-dependent regulation underlying the anti-atherosclerotic potential of IL-35 remains elusive.
Methods  THP-1 macrophages were incubated with human recombinant IL-35 (rIL-35) either in the presence or absence of ox-LDL. qRT-PCR was conducted to validate the expression levels of previously identified miRNAs including miR-197-5p, miR-4442, miR-324-3p, miR-6879-5p, and miR-6069 that were differentially expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients vs. controls. Additionally, bioinformatic analysis was performed to predict miRNA-associated targets and their corresponding functional significance in CAD.
Results  Exogenous IL-35 significantly decreased the average area of ox-LDL-stimulated macrophages, indicating the inhibitory effect of IL-35 on lipid-laden foam cell formation. Furthermore, rIL-35 treatment alleviated the ox-LDL-mediated atherogenic effects by modulating the expression levels of aforementioned CAD-associated miRNAs in the cultured macrophages. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis of these miRNA-related targets revealed their role in the molecular processes affecting different stages of atheroslerotic plaque development, such as macrophage polarization, T cell suppression, lipoprotein metabolism, foam cell formation, and iNOS-mediated inflammation.
Conclusion  Our observations uncover the novel role of IL-35 as an epigenetic modifier as it influences the expression level of miRNAs implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Thus, IL-35 cytokine therapy–mediated miRNA targeting could be an effective therapeutic strategy against the development of early atheromas in asymptomatic high-risk CAD patients.},

The present review points out the sensitivity and specificity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as an intact source of biomarkers in a variety of diseases. Multiple recent studies that have used PBMCs as a source of biomarkers reveal the alteration of mRNAs/microRNAs (miRNAs) signature and methylation profile in many kinds of disorders; for instance, dysregulation of mRNAs/ miRNAs in schizophrenia, diabetes and different types of cancers and change in the methylation status of LINE-1 in neoplasms. In conclusion with a strong probability, PBMCs mimic conditions of some tissues which are in contact with them like the tumour cells, hence providing a non-invasive and suitable source of biomarkers.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular calcification is one of the most severe outcomes associated with cardiovascular disease and often results in significant morbidity and mortality. Previous reports indicated that epigenomic regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) might play important roles in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification. Here, we identified potential key miRNAs involved in vascular calcification in vivo and investigated the role of miR-32-5p (miR-32). According to microarray analysis, we observed increased expression of miR-125b, miR30a, and miR-32 and decreased expression of miR-29a, miR-210, and miR-320 during the progression of vascularcalcification. Additionally, gain- and loss-of-function studies of miR32 confirmed promotion of VSMC calcification in mice through the enhanced expression of bonemorphogenetic protein-2, runt-related transcription factor-2(RUNX2), osteopontin, and the bone-specific phosphoprotein matrix GLA protein in vitro. Moreover, miR-32 modulated vascularcalcification progression by activating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)signaling and increasing RUNX2 expression and phosphorylation by targeting the 30-untranslated region of phosphatase and tensin homolog Mrna (PTEN) in mouse VSMCs. Furthermore, we detected higher miR-32 levels in plasmafrom patients with coronary artery disease with coronary artery calcification (CAC) as compared with levels observed in non-CAC patients (P = 0.016), further confirming miR-32 as a critical modulator and potential diagnostic marker for CAC.},

	abstract = {Aims {MicroRNA} ({miRNA}) is reported to be present in the blood of humans and has been increasingly suggested as a biomarker for diseases. We aim to determine the potential of cardiac-specific {miRNAs} in circulation to serve as biomarkers for acute myocardial infarction ({AMI}).

Methods and results By verifying their tissue expression patterns with real-time polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) analysis, muscle-enriched {miRNAs} ({miR}-1, {miR}-133a, and {miR}-499) and cardiac-specific {miR}-208a were selected as candidates for this study. With {miRNA} microarray and real-time {PCR} analyses, {miR}-1, {miR}-133a, and {miR}-499 were present with very low abundance, and {miR}-208a was absent in the plasma from healthy people. In the {AMI} rats, the plasma levels of these {miRNAs} were significantly increased. Especially, {miR}-208a in plasma was undetected at 0 h, but was significantly increased to a detectable level as early as 1 h after coronary artery occlusion. Further evaluation of the {miRNA} levels in plasma from {AMI} patients ( n = 33) demonstrated that all four {miRNA} levels were substantially higher than those from healthy people ( n = 30, P {\textless}0.01), patients with non-{AMI} coronary heart disease ( n = 16, P {\textless}0.01), or patients with other cardiovascular diseases ( n = 17, P {\textless}0.01). Notably, {miR}-208a remained undetectable in non-{AMI} patients, but was easily detected in 90.9\% {AMI} patients and in 100\% {AMI} patients within 4 h of the onset of symptoms. By receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, among the four {miRNAs} investigated, {miR}-208a revealed the higher sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing {AMI}.

Conclusion Elevated cardiac-specific {miR}-208a in plasma may be a novel biomarker for early detection of myocardial injury in humans.},

	abstract = {Regardless of the newly diagnostic and therapeutic advances, coronary artery disease ({CAD}) and more explicitly, {ST}-elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI}), remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Thus, early and prompt diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction is pivotal in {STEMI} patients for a better prognosis and outcome. In recent years, {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) gained attention as potential biomarkers in myocardial infarction ({MI}) and acute coronary syndromes ({ACS}), as they have key roles in heart development, various cardiac processes, and act as indicators of cardiac damage. In this review, we describe the current available knowledge about cardiac {miRNAs} and their functions, and focus mainly on their potential use as novel circulating diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in {STEMI}.},

	abstract = {Extracellular circulating {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) are currently a focus of interest as non-invasive biomarkers of cardiovascular pathologies, including coronary artery disease ({CAD}) and acute coronary syndromes ({ACS}): myocardial infarction with and without {ST}-segment elevation ({STEMI} and {NSTEMI}) and unstable angina ({UA}). However, the current data for some {miRNAs} are controversial and inconsistent, probably due to pre-analytical and methodological variances in different studies. In this work, we fulfilled the basic pre-analytical requirements provided for circulating {miRNA} studies for application to stable {CAD} and {ACS} research. We used quantitative {PCR} to determine the relative plasma levels of eight circulating {miRNAs} that are potentially associated with atherosclerosis. In a cohort of 136 adult clinic {CAD} patients and outpatient controls, we found that the plasma levels of {miR}-21-5p and {miR}-146a-5p were significantly elevated in {ACS} patients, and the level of {miR}-17-5p was decreased in {ACS} and stable {CAD} patients compared to both healthy controls and hypertensive patients without {CAD}. Within the {ACS} patient group, no differences were found in the plasma levels of these {miRNAs} between patients with positive and negative troponin, nor were any differences found between {STEMI} and {NSTEMI}. Our results indicate that increased plasma levels of {miR}-146a-5p and {miR}-21-5p can be considered general {ACS} circulating biomarkers and that lowered {miR}-17-5p can be considered a general biomarker of {CAD}.},

	abstract = {Background/Aims: This study aimed to compare the clinical value of the peak time point and area under the curve ({AUC}) of {miRNAs} and conventional biomarkers in acute myocardial infarction ({AMI}).
Methods: A literature search was carried out in {PubMed}, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane systematically. Screening studies, extracting data, and assessing article quality were performed independently by two researchers. Also, the names of {miRNAs} in the included studies were standardized by the {miRBase} database.
Results: A total of 40 studies, encompassing 6,960 participants, were included in this systematic review. The samples of circulating {miRNAs} were mainly from the plasma. The results of this systematic review displayed that {miR}-1-3p, {miR}-19b-3p, {miR}-22-5p, {miR}122-5p, {miR}-124-3p, {miR}-133a/b, {miR}-134-5p, {miR}-150-5p, {miR}-186-5p, {miR}-208a, {miR}-223-3p, {miR}-483-5p, and {miR}-499a-5p reached peak time earlier and showed a shorter time window than the conventional biomarkers despite the different collection times of initial blood samples. {miR}-1-3p, {miR}-19b-3p, {miR}-133a/b, {miR}-208a/b, {miR}223-3p, {miR}-483-5p, and {miR}-499a-5p were shown to be more valuable than classical biomarkers for the early diagnosis of {AMI}, and these {miRNAs} appeared to have the most potential biomarkers within 4 h of the onset of symptoms except {miR}-133a/b and {miR}-208b. Moreover, combined {miRNAs} or {miRNAs} combined with classical biomarkers could compensate for the deﬁciency of single {miRNA} and conventional biomarker in sensitivity or speciﬁcity for an optimal clinical value.
Conclusions: {miR}-1-3p, {miR}-19b-3p, {miR}-208a, {miR}-223-3p, {miR}-483-5p, and {miR}-499a-5p are promising biomarkers for {AMI} due to their satisfactory diagnostic accuracy and short time window (within 4 h of the onset of symptoms).},
