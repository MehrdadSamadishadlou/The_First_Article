	abstract = {Background: The American Heart Association, in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health, annually reports the most up-to-date statistics related to heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular risk factors, including core health behaviors (smoking, physical activity, diet, and weight) and health factors (cholesterol, blood pressure, and glucose control) that contribute to cardiovascular health. The Statistical Update presents the latest data on a range of major clinical heart and circulatory disease conditions (including stroke, congenital heart disease, rhythm disorders, subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, heart failure, valvular disease, venous disease, and peripheral artery disease) and the associated outcomes (including quality of care, procedures, and economic costs).
Methods: The American Heart Association, through its Statistics Committee, continuously monitors and evaluates sources of data on heart disease and stroke in the United States to provide the most current information available in the annual Statistical Update. The 2022 Statistical Update is the product of a full year’s worth of effort by dedicated volunteer clinicians and scientists, committed government professionals, and American Heart Association staff members. This year’s edition includes data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population and an enhanced focus on social determinants of health, adverse pregnancy outcomes, vascular contributions to brain health, and the global burden of cardiovascular disease and healthy life expectancy.
Results: Each of the chapters in the Statistical Update focuses on a different topic related to heart disease and stroke statistics.
Conclusions: The Statistical Update represents a critical resource for the lay public, policymakers, media professionals, clinicians, health care administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best available data on these factors and conditions.},

	abstract = {Background: CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells) play a protective role against the development and progression of the inflammatory disease atherosclerosis (AS). MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is expressed in Treg cells and is up-regulated in the context of AS and other inflammatory diseases. Aims: This study aimed to determine the role of miR21 in Treg cell regulation and gene expression during the development of AS in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Methods and Results: MiR-21 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was significantly up-regulated in patients with CHD (acute myocardial infarction (AMI) group, n=24; unstable angina (UA) group, n=21; stable angina (SA) group, n=24) compared with patients with chest pain syndrome (CPS, n=27), and miR21 expression showed an increasing trend from SA to UA to AMI patients. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis indicated that the frequencies of circulating Treg cells decreased in a manner proportionate opposite with the level of miR-21. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR) revealed a decrease in mRNA expression of forkhead box P3 (foxp3), transforming cell growth factor beta 1(TGF-$\beta1$) and smad7 (a known target gene of miR-21).ELISA analysis revealed a decrease in TGF-$\beta1$ secreted into the plasma. In addition, we transfected PBMCs with a miRNA negative control (NS-m), a miR-21 mimic (miR-21-m), a miRNA inhibitor negative control (NS-i),or a miR-21 inhibitor(miR-21-i). Up-regulation of miR-21 decreased the frequency of circulating Treg cells, decreased the expression levels of foxp3, TGF-$\beta1$ and smad7, and decreased the amount of TGF-$\beta1$ secreted into the plasma. Consistent with these observations, miR-21 down-regulation increased the frequency of circulating Treg cells, increased the expression of foxp3, TGF-$\beta1$ and smad7, and increased the amount of TGF-$\beta1$ secreted into the plasma. Conclusions: Because the smad7 expression pattern was similar to that of TGF-$\beta$, our study suggests that miR-21 can negatively regulate the frequency of circulating Treg cells through a TGF-$\beta1$/smad-independent signaling pathway in PBMCs.},

	abstract = {Background/Aims: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory condition associated with a variety of vascular diseases. Previous studies showed that both miR-29a and oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) were vital in the development of atherosclerosis. However, the relationship between miR-29a and ox-LDL remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the association of miR-29a and ox-LDL and to test whether circulating miR-29a and ox-LDL levels could predict atherosclerosis. Methods: In 170 participants, plasma levels of miR-29a were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) while plasma ox-LDL levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The relationship between miR-29a level and ox-LDL and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient and multiple liner regression. Results: Compared with the normal cIMT group, the increased cIMT group had higher levels of ox-LDL (0.47 ± 0.08 vs 0.29 ± 0.06 ng/ml, p = 0.003) and miR-29a (32.93 ± 4.26 vs 26.37 ± 1.04, p {\textless} 0.001). A positive correlation was found between ox-LDL and miR-29a (r = 0.695, p {\textless} 0.001), and both the ox-LDL (r = 0.857, p {\textless} 0.001) and the miR-29a (r = 0.753, p {\textless} 0.001) were positively related to cIMT. Furthermore, multiple liner regression indicated that a significant correlation between ox-LDL and cIMT (β = 0.768, p {\textless} 0.001), as well as between miR-29a and cIMT (β = 0.686, p {\textless}0.001). The combination of miR-29a and ox-LDL (AUC = 0.926, p {\textless} 0.001) offered a better predictive value for atherosclerosis than either miR-29a (AUC = 0.759, p {\textless} 0.001) or ox-LDL (AUC = 0.762, p {\textless} 0.001) alone. Conclusion: Increased miR-29a and ox-LDL levels were associated with an early stage of atherosclerosis, and the combination of miR-29a and ox-LDL offered better predictive values for atherosclerosis than either alone.},

Moreover, their abnormal expression contributes to the etiology of numerous diseases. In the current review, we aimed to summarize the differential expression patterns and functional roles of the miR‐29 family in the etiology of diseases including osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, cardiorenal, and immune disease. Furthermore, we highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting members of miR‐29 family in these diseases. We present miR‐29s as promoters of osteoblast differentiation and apoptosis but suppressors of chondrogenic and osteoclast differentiation, fibrosis, and T cell differentiation, with clear avenues for therapeutic manipulation. Further research will be crucial to identify the precise mechanism of miR‐29 family in these diseases and their full potential in therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a common hematopoietic malignancy with invasive activity. Drug resistance greatly contributes to the poor efficacy of chemotherapy in AML treatment. Recent research indicates that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) regulates chemotherapy resistance in malignancy.
Methods: Microarray analysis was used to screen out AML related genes, and interaction between small nucleolar RNA host gene 5(SNHG5) and miR-32, as well as that between miR-32 and DNAJB9. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and In situ hybridization(ISH) were used to determine the expression levels of SNHG5, miR-32 and DNAJB9 mRNA in AML cell lines and clinic samples. Western blot was performed to detect protein expression levels. After being treated with varying concentrations of Adriamycin(ADM), cell viability was evaluated using a cell counting kit-8(CCK8).
Results: We carried out a genome-wide LncRNA expression study and found SNHG5 aberrantly overexpressed in AML comparing to the donors. Knock-down of SNHG5 promoted sensitivity of AML cells to chemotherapy. In addition, miR-32 was identified as the downstream target of SNHG5 and miR-32 inhibitor abrogated the inhibiting effects of downregulated SNHG5 on AML cell viability. Furthermore, inhibited SNHG5 decreased DNAJB9 expression levels by sponging miR-32. The SNHG5/miR-32/DNAJB9 axis targeted autophagy to regulate chemotherapy resistance.
Conclusion: SHNG5 regulates chemotherapy resistance by targeting the miR-32/DNAJB9 axis in acute myeloid leukemia, which provided a novel potential target for AML and revealed an important mechanism of chemotherapy resistance.},

	abstract = {Cardiac fibrosis is a primary phenotype of cardiac remodeling that contributes to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. The expansion and activation of CD4+ T cells in the heart has been identified to facilitate pathological cardiac remodeling and dysfunction; however, the underlying mechanisms remained not well clarified. Herein, we found that exosomes derived from activated CD4+ T cells (CD4-activated Exos) evoked pro-fibrotic effects of cardiac fibroblasts, and their delivery into the heart aggravated cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction post-infarction. Mechanistically, miR-142-3p that was enriched in CD4-activated Exos recapitulated the pro-fibrotic effects of CD4-activated Exos in cardiac fibroblasts, and vice versa. Furthermore, miR-142-3p directly targeted and inhibited the expression of Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC), a negative WNT signaling pathway regulator, contributing to the activation of WNT signaling pathway and cardiac fibroblast activation. Thus, CD4-activated Exos promote post-ischemic cardiac fibrosis through exosomal miR-142-3p-WNT signaling cascade-mediated activation of myofibroblasts. Targeting miR-142-3p in CD4-activated Exos may hold promise for treating cardiac remodeling post-MI.},

Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated form blood simple from patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), unstable angina (UAP), stable angina (SAP) and chest pain syndrome (CPS). RT-PCR was performed to analysis the expression level of miR-155 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, plasma and RAW264.7 macrophagocyte. MTT was used to analyze the cell viability of OxLDL treated RAW264.7 macrophagocyte. Results: The expression level of miR-155 in blood sample from coronary heart disease patients was much lower than in the blood sample of non-coronary heart disease (P{\textless}0.05). The level of miR-155 in PBMCs was much higher in the blood sample from CPS group than the other three group, and the level of miR-155 in plasma was higher in the CPS group than in the UAP and the AMI group, the difference was statistically significant (P{\textless}0.05). The expression level of miR-155 in PBMCs is positively associated with the level in the plasma (r=0.861, P=0.000). OxLDL can induce the expression of miR-155 in RAW264.7 macrophagocyte, decrease the cell viability of RAW264.7 macrophagocyte, and with the concentration and the treatment time of OxLDL increased, the effort become more obvious. The inhibition effort of OxLDL to RAW264.7 macrophagocyte with high miR-155 expression is much lower than the control group, and it is statistically significant after treated for 12, 24 and 48 h. Conclusions: miR-155 plays a protective role in the progression of atherosclerosis, and it may be achieved by reducing the apoptosis effort of OxLDL to RAW264.7 macrophagocyte.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Several studies suggest that cardiomyocyte-enriched miR-186 is involved in cardiac injury and myocardial infarction, and also plays an important role in atherosclerotic diseases, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Cystathionine-g-lyase (CSE) is the predominant enzyme to produce H2S in the cardiovascular system. Here, miR-186 was identiﬁed to bind to the 30UTR of CSE. In this study, we aimed at exploring whether miR-186 affects lipid accumulation and secretion of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines by targeting CSE and its underlying mechanism in human THP-1 macrophages and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (PBMDM). PBMDM just as a control group for the comparison with the THP-1 macrophages.
Methods: MiR-186 target genes, CSE 30UTR sequence and free energy were predicted and analyzed by bioinformatics analyses and dual-luciferase reporter assays. The expression of CSE mRNA and protein were measured by real-time quantitative PCR and western blot analyses. The lipid accumulation in THP-1 macrophages was detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The effects of miR-186 on secretion of IL-6, IL-1b and TNF-a were examined by ELISA. Endogenous H2S was detected by spectrophotometry. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach to decrease the expression of CSE protein and mRNA.
Results: We found that miR-186 directly inhibited CSE protein and mRNA expression through targeting CSE 30UTR by bioinformatics analyses and dual-luciferase reporter assays. HPLC assays showed that miR186 increased the lipid accumulation in human THP-1 macrophages. We also showed that miR-186 enhanced secretion of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines in human THP-1 macrophages. Using siRNA approach, we found that CSE siRNA could inhibit the miR-186 inhibitor-induced decrease in the expression of LPL protein and mRNA in human THP-1 macrophages, which was accompanied a decrease in the level of H2S.

	abstract = {Purpose  Recent emergence of miRNAs as important regulators of processes involving lesion formation and regression has highlighted miRNAs as potent therapeutic targets for the treatment of atherosclerosis. Few studies have reported the atheroprotective role of IL-35, a novel immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory cytokine; however, miRNA-dependent regulation underlying the anti-atherosclerotic potential of IL-35 remains elusive.
Methods  THP-1 macrophages were incubated with human recombinant IL-35 (rIL-35) either in the presence or absence of ox-LDL. qRT-PCR was conducted to validate the expression levels of previously identified miRNAs including miR-197-5p, miR-4442, miR-324-3p, miR-6879-5p, and miR-6069 that were differentially expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients vs. controls. Additionally, bioinformatic analysis was performed to predict miRNA-associated targets and their corresponding functional significance in CAD.
Results  Exogenous IL-35 significantly decreased the average area of ox-LDL-stimulated macrophages, indicating the inhibitory effect of IL-35 on lipid-laden foam cell formation. Furthermore, rIL-35 treatment alleviated the ox-LDL-mediated atherogenic effects by modulating the expression levels of aforementioned CAD-associated miRNAs in the cultured macrophages. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis of these miRNA-related targets revealed their role in the molecular processes affecting different stages of atheroslerotic plaque development, such as macrophage polarization, T cell suppression, lipoprotein metabolism, foam cell formation, and iNOS-mediated inflammation.
Conclusion  Our observations uncover the novel role of IL-35 as an epigenetic modifier as it influences the expression level of miRNAs implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Thus, IL-35 cytokine therapy–mediated miRNA targeting could be an effective therapeutic strategy against the development of early atheromas in asymptomatic high-risk CAD patients.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of endogenous, small (∼22 nts in length) noncoding RNA molecules that function specifically by base pairing with the mRNA of genes and regulate gene expression at the post-­transcriptional level. Alterations in miR-­32 expression have been found in numerous diseases and shown to play a vital role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, oncogenesis, invasion, metastasis and drug resistance. MiR-­32 has been documented as an oncomiR in the majority of related studies but has been also verified as a tumour suppressor miRNA in conflicting reports. Moreover, it has a crucial role in metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. This review provides an in-­depth look into the most recent finding regarding miR-­32, which is involved in the expression, regulation and functions in different diseases, especially tumours. Additionally, this review outlines novel findings suggesting that miR-­32 may be useful as a noninvasive biomarker and as a targeted therapeutic in several diseases.},

	abstract = {There are various types of molecular biomarkers that are derived from distinct starting materials. Although many indirect biomarkers are found in blood, their detection remains a challenging issue because of the high degree of fragmentation, minute quantity and a vast amount of non-specific background. The present review points out the sensitivity and specificity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as an intact source of biomarkers in a variety of diseases. Multiple recent studies that have used PBMCs as a source of biomarkers reveal the alteration of mRNAs/microRNAs (miRNAs) signature and methylation profile in many kinds of disorders; for instance, dysregulation of mRNAs/ miRNAs in schizophrenia, diabetes and different types of cancers and change in the methylation status of LINE-1 in neoplasms. In conclusion with a strong probability, PBMCs mimic conditions of some tissues which are in contact with them like the tumour cells, hence providing a non-invasive and suitable source of biomarkers.},

Antigen-specificity is a hallmark of T-cell responses but the cardiac antigens that trigger heart-directed T-cell responses in patients have not yet been uncovered, thus posing a roadblock to translation. In the present exploratory study, we identified a peptide fragment of the beta-1 adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) that elicits CD4+ T-cell responses after myocardial infarction in patients with a defined HLA haplotype. Our obser­ vations may advance the development of tools to monitor other antigen-specific immune responses in patients.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular calcification is one of the most severe outcomes associated with cardiovascular disease and often results in significant morbidity and mortality. Previous reports indicated that epigenomic regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) might play important roles in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification. Here, we identified potential key miRNAs involved in vascular calcification in vivo and investigated the role of miR-32-5p (miR-32). According to microarray analysis, we observed increased expression of miR-125b, miR30a, and miR-32 and decreased expression of miR-29a, miR-210, and miR-320 during the progression of vascularcalcification. Additionally, gain- and loss-of-function studies of miR32 confirmed promotion of VSMC calcification in mice through the enhanced expression of bonemorphogenetic protein-2, runt-related transcription factor-2(RUNX2), osteopontin, and the bone-specific phosphoprotein matrix GLA protein in vitro. Moreover, miR-32 modulated vascularcalcification progression by activating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)signaling and increasing RUNX2 expression and phosphorylation by targeting the 30-untranslated region of phosphatase and tensin homolog Mrna (PTEN) in mouse VSMCs. Furthermore, we detected higher miR-32 levels in plasmafrom patients with coronary artery disease with coronary artery calcification (CAC) as compared with levels observed in non-CAC patients (P = 0.016), further confirming miR-32 as a critical modulator and potential diagnostic marker for CAC.},

	abstract = {Cardiac fibrosis could induce abnormal cardiac function and become a novel target for cardiac hypertrophy and chronic heart failure. MiRNA-320 is a crucial miRNA in cardiovascular disease, but it is poorly understood whether it plays a role in cardiac fibrosis pathogenesis. We aimed to identify the specific underlying mechanism of miR-320 in cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophic pathogenesis. In our study, the GEO datasets revealed that STAT3 was significantly highly expressed in cardiomyocyte lines. MiR-320 activation and STAT3 signaling pathways were statistically significantly connected. Furthermore, miR-320 was highly associated with cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophic disease. Interstitial fibrosis was observed in the mice subjected to TAC surgery, markedly enhanced in miR-320 mimics. Mechanistically, we revealed that miR-320 mimics aggravated the pressure overload and induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis via the IL6/STAT3/PTEN axis. MiR-320 mimics accelerated cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis via the IL6/STAT3/PTEN axis. These results suggest that targeting miR-320 may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.},
